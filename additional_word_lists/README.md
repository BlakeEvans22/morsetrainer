Claus' Morse Trainer
====================

This folder contains additional word list that can be uploaded into the "Claus' Morse Trainer" directory of your android device.

The supercheckpartial files are great to practice call signs.  These callsigns are of active contesters.  The "repeated" version sends the call sign three times before giving the answer.  More detail at http://www.supercheckpartial.com/ .
