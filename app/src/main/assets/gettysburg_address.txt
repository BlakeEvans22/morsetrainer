four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
upon
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
battle
field
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
it
as
a
final
resting
place
for
those
who
died
here
that
the
nation
might
live
this
we
may
in
all
propriety
do
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
we
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground  
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
hallowed
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
while
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
rather
for
us
the
living
to
stand
here
we
here
be
dedica ted
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
that
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
here
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
the
nation
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
